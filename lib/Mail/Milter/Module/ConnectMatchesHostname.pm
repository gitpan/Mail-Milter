=head1 NAME

Mail::Milter::Module::ConnectMatchesHostname - milter to accept/reject connecting hosts matching regex(es)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mail::Milter::Module::ConnectMatchesHostname;

    my $milter = new Mail::Milter::Module::ConnectMatchesHostname;

    my $milter2 = &ConnectMatchesHostname; # convenience

    $milter2->set_message('Connecting hostname %H looks like a dynamic address');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This milter module rejects any connecting host whose hostname contains one
of a group of built-in patterns that match the IP address of the connecting
host.  This is normally used to detect dynamic pool addresses.

Currently the following patterns embedded in the hostname are considered
matching, where 10.11.12.13 is the IPv4 address of the connecting host.  
In the following cases, the string must be preceded by a non-digit
character or otherwise must be at the start of the hostname.

    010011012013.
    010.011.012.013. (optionally without internal dots)
    010-011-012-013.
    013.012.011.010.
    10.11.12.13. (optionally without internal dots)
    10-11-12-13.
    13.12.11.10.
    0A0B0C0D (hexadecimal, ignoring case)

More specific patterns are anticipated to be added in the future.  Because
of this, if you use ConnectMatchesHostname, pay attention to this perldoc
manual page when updating to a newer version of Mail::Milter.

One final note.  ISPs can and do use "dynamic-looking" reverse DNS entries
for what they consider to be legitimate server addresses.  This is not
ideal, and may require embedding this module in a Chain set to
"accept_break" with regular expressions; for example:

    my $milter = new Mail::Milter::Chain(
        &ConnectRegex(
            '\.fooisp\.com$',
        )->accept_match(1);
        &ConnectMatchesHostname,
    )->accept_break(1);

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=cut

our @EXPORT = qw(&ConnectMatchesHostname);

sub ConnectMatchesHostname {
	new Mail::Milter::Module::ConnectMatchesHostname(@_);
}

=pod

=item new()

Creates a ConnectMatchesHostname object.

=cut

sub new ($) {
	my $this = Mail::Milter::Object::new(shift);

	$this->{_message} = 'Connecting hostname %H looks like a dynamic pool address (contains the connecting address %A)';

	$this;
}

=pod

=item set_message(MESSAGE)

Sets the message used when rejecting connections.  This string may contain
the substring C<%H>, which will be replaced by the matching hostname, and/or
the substring C<%A>, which will be replaced by the matching IP address.

This method returns a reference to the object itself, allowing this method
call to be chained.

=head1 BUGS

In Sendmail 8.11 and 8.12, a milter rejection at "connect" stage does not
allow the reply message to be set -- it simply becomes "not accepting
messages".  However, this module still attempts to set the reply code and
message in the hope that this will be fixed.

The implementation of this module could be much more efficient.
