=head1 NAME

Mail::Milter::Module::HeloUnqualified - milter to check for an unqualified HELO name

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mail::Milter::Module::HeloUnqualified;

    my $milter = new Mail::Milter::Module::HeloUnqualified([EXCEPT]);

    my $milter2 = &HeloUnqualified([EXCEPT]); # convenience

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This milter module rejects any domain name that HELOs without a dot, and
which is not an IPv4/IPv6 literal.  Whether or not the HELO value
corresponds to the connecting host is not checked by this module.

If the EXCEPT argument is supplied, it should be a regex enclosed in a
string which will be exempted from this check.  Commonly, '^localhost' is
excepted.
