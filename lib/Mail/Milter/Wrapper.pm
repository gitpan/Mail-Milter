=head1 NAME

Mail::Milter::Wrapper - Perl extension for wrappering milter objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mail::Milter::Wrapper;

    my $milter = ...;
    my $wrapper = new Mail::Milter::Wrapper($milter, \&foo);

    use Sendmail::Milter;
    ...
    Sendmail::Milter::register('foo', $wrapper, SMFI_CURR_ACTS);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mail::Milter::Wrapper wraps another milter, allowing for interception
of the passed arguments and/or return code of the contained milter.

=item new(MILTER, CODEREF[, CALLBACK ...])

Creates a Mail::Milter::Wrapper object.

MILTER is the milter to wrap, which may be a plain hash reference or an
instance of a hashref object such as C<Mail::Milter::Object>.  CODEREF is
the wrapper subroutine.  CALLBACKs, if specified, are named callbacks
which are needed by the wrapper, even if the contained milter does not use
them.

The wrapper subroutine will be called with the following arguments, in
this order:

 * reference to the wrapper
 * name of callback
 * subroutine reference to call into the wrapped milter
 * arguments for the callback (>= 0)

This subroutine should ALWAYS pass the "close" callback through to the
contained milter.  Failure to do so may corrupt the contained milter's
state information and cause memory leaks.

As an example, a simple subroutine which just passes the callback through
might be written as:

    sub callback_wrapper {
        shift; # don't need $this
        my $cbname = shift;
        my $callback_sub = shift;

        &$callback_sub(@_);
    }

=cut

sub new ($$&;@) {
	my $this = bless {}, shift;
	my $callbacks = shift;
	my $wrapper_sub = shift || croak 'new Wrapper: wrapper_sub is undef';
	my %needed_cbs = map { $_ => 1 } @_;

	my $pkg = caller;

	foreach my $cbname (keys %Sendmail::Milter::DEFAULT_CALLBACKS) {
		my $cbref = $callbacks->{$cbname};

		if (defined($cbref)) {
			$cbref = Mail::Milter::resolve_callback($cbref, $pkg);
		} elsif (defined($needed_cbs{$cbname})) {
			$cbref = sub { SMFIS_CONTINUE; };
		}

		next unless defined($cbref);

		$this->{$cbname} = sub {
			&$wrapper_sub($this, $cbname, $cbref, @_);
		};
	}

	$this;
}
