Mail::Milter version 0.02
=========================

$Id: README,v 1.7 2004/02/25 16:40:10 tvierling Exp $

Mail::Milter is a set of modules useful to mail filter writers who are
using the Sendmail::Milter and/or Sendmail::PMilter APIs to interface
directly to the SMTP transaction.  Among those currently included are:

Mail::Milter::Chain
    A milter container.  This allows multiple milter instances to exist
    within a single milter server, and still play together nicely.  
    With this, an almost rule-based meta-milter can be created.

Mail::Milter::Object
    Allows a milter to exist as a blessed object, using method names
    rather than subroutine references to supply the callbacks.  This adds
    modularity and makes milter objects easier to understand.

Mail::Milter::Wrapper
    "Wraps" a milter with a user-supplied interception subroutine.  This
    can be used to defer a failure return code, add a descriptive message,
    and many other things.

Mail::Milter::Module::*
    Off-the-shelf milter modules that perform commonly used functions.
    Most useful in conjunction with Mail::Milter::Chain.

Mail::Milter::Wrapper::*
    Off-the-shelf milter wrappers that can perform commonly desired
    editing operations on milter return codes.
